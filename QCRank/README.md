# QCRank - External Comment Selection and Ranking Tool for Community Question Answering sites
QCRank is licensed under ASL 2.0 and other lenient licenses, allowing its use for academic and commercial purposes without restrictions.

# Quick Run
* Simply download the script `run_QCRank.py` from [here](https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank/releases/download/1.0/run_QCRank.py).
* Copy the file to a destination having enough space for a few downloads and run the script as `python run_QCRank.py`.
* In this case, the script does not run the jar file as it depends on the results of the other toolkits and consistency of data.
* It downloads required data and creates folders with some training and test files from the Qatar Living Data. To make your own changes and run the jar follow procedures below. 

# Experimentation
* Download the jar file of the project from [here](https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank/releases/download/1.0/QCRank.jar).
* Alternatively, download the [zip](https://github.com/TitasNandi/QCRank/archive/1.0.zip) of the java project and import it as a **maven** project in eclipse for experimentation.

## Downloading Data
* QCRank requires a training xml file, a test xml file and unannotated data to train models.
* The system was trained and tested on **[SemEval 2017 - Task 3: Community Question Answering](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task3/) Subtask C** data.
* Create a directory named **xml_files** in your local machine.
* The training+dev data can be downloaded from [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task3/data/uploads/semeval2016-task3-cqa-ql-traindev-v3.2.zip).
* The test data for 2017 can be downloaded from [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task3/data/uploads/semeval2017_task3_test_input_abcd.zip).
* After unzipping this folder, move to `semeval2016-task3-cqa-ql-traindev-v3.2/v3.2/train/`. The entire training data for Task 3 can be found here. 
 * Choose `SemEval2016-Task3-CQA-QL-train-part1.xml` or `SemEval2016-Task3-CQA-QL-train-part2.xml` train files for training and copy it to *xml_files* directory. Rename the training file **train.xml**.
 * Alternatively, combine various training xml files into one file *train.xml* for larger training data. Make sure to preserve the XML tree structure while doing this.
* Similarly, choose dev/test files in `semeval2016-task3-cqa-ql-traindev-v3.2/v3.2/dev/` or `semeval2016_task3_tests/SemEval2016_task3_test/English/` as test data and rename it **test.xml**.
* The unannotated data can be downloaded from [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task3/data/uploads/QL-unannotated-data-subtaskA.xml.zip).
* Download the *python scripts* required to run the system from [here](https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank/releases/download/1.0/resources_QCRank.zip).
* Unzip this `resources_QCRank` folder in a suitable place.
* The trained word embeddings on the large unannotated data can be found [here](https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank/releases/download/1.0/vectors_unannotated.txt).

## Running QCRank
* Running QCRank jar can be done in two sequential steps
  * Run QCRank for the generic set of features
  ```
  java -Xmx10g -jar QCRank.jar [absolute-path-to-xml_files-folder] [absolute-path-to-resources-folder] [absolute-path-to-result_files-QARank] [absolute-path-to-result_files-QQRank]
  ```
  * Subsequently, Run QCRank along with the stacking features obtained from the scores of QARank (subtask A) and QQRank (subtask B)
    * With an additional argument, run QCRank as
     ```
     java -Xmx10g -jar QQRank.jar [absolute-path-to-xml_files-folder] [absolute-path-to-resources-folder] [absolute-path-to-result_files-QARank] [absolute-path-to-result_files-QQRank] stacking
     ```  
## Results
* The system will generate all folders and required files.
* The final MAP scores of the system and the SVM accuracy can be found in **result_files/final_scores.txt** file.
* Users can run the system on a different dataset, given the training and test files are in the format as in SemEval 2017 - Task 3.  
* The evaluation scripts used in the system can be looked up [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task3/data/uploads/semeval2017_task3_submissions_and_scores.zip).
