## Features

**1. String Similarity Features**

The String Similarity Features include various String Similarity metrics that find the string match between question and comment.
* n-gram distance (n = 1,2,3)
* cosine similarity (n = 1,2,3)
* Jaccard similarity (n = 1,2,3)
* QGram distance (n = 1,2,3)
* Sorensen similarity (n = 1,2,3)
* JaroWinkler similarity
* Damerau distance
* Levenshtein distance
* Normalized Levenshtein distance
* Longest Common Subsequence

**2. Dialogue Identification Features**

This set of features finds explicit dialogue chains among users by 
* Repeated comments by the same user
* If a user mentions another in the comment

**3. Meta Data Features**

This set of features encapsulates the position of comment, if the comment is an acknowledgment and the length of the comment.

**4. Word Embedding Features**

We train word embeddings of dimension 100 using [Word2Vec](http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec) on unannotated data. From these we compute sentence vectors and various distance metrics between question and comment.

**5. Topic features**

We train an LDA Topic Model using [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) and find topic distributions in training and test data. From these topic vectors and words, we obtain various features.

**6. User Features**

These features are extracted from the User and Dialogue Graph constructed from inter comment dependencies. 

**7. Keyword Features**

This computes the keyword match and uses the relative weight of common keywords as features, finding the focus of the question and comment.

## Evaluation
We combine all feature files, normalize it and feed it to a Support Vector Machine for binary classification. We use the SVM probability scores for ranking purposes.
The scoring measure used is Mean Average Precision (MAP).
