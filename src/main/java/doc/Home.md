**QARank** is a **freely available open source tool** for Answer Selection and Ranking in Community Question Answering sites. The tool has been trained and tested on the **SemEval 2017 Task 3** data. Though the tool has been applied on CQA sites' data until now, it can easily be used for **feature extraction** and **answer quality detection** on data available from other sources as well.

The system when tested on the test data of SemEval 2017 for subtask A gives results which are at par with the best systems which participated in this task. The MAP score of our primary submission in this subtask is **86.88** and our submission stood at the 3rd position overall. The detailed results can be checked [here](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task3/data/uploads/semeval2017_task3_results.pdf). 

The tool takes a **feature based** approach for good answer selection and ranking. The tool combines various **String Similarity, word embedding, dialogue identification, topic modeling and numerous domain specific features** to build a robust Question Answering Model. The software components, the training data and all data used for feature generation are distributed under permissive licenses, thus this ranker tool can be used in academic and commercial settings without restrictions or fees.
